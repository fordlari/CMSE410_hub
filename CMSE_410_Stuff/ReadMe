#Packages
###Note: I installed most packages using anaconda becasue I already have it. There are multiple installation options for all the packages and the one chosen is unimportant
## Gggenes
 
Gggene is a gene visualization tool that will display the genetic info (ie direction, length, location) of genes in a nice format. I chose this r package since it is being used by other project members on the MolEvol App for domain visualiztion. This will allow there to be consistency within the app for different data displays.
Gggenes is a ggplot2 extension

installed with: conda install -c conda-forge r-gggenes

## Ggplot
gggenes requires ggplot2 to operate. This is part of the tidyverse package.

Installed with: conda install -c r r-tidyverse

### Note: 4/4/2021, today I learned that R-Studio only runs the line of code that is selected, not the entire thing. It took me a week to discover that there was not something wrong with my code, but that it wasn't running the correct lines. I did so much research into installing gggenes and tidyverse, and checking my example data, and it turned out that there was not an issue. I suppose this is what programming is.

##DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Accession Prefix Format
The format for GenBank Accession numbers are:
Nucleotide:    1 letter + 5 numerals
               2 letters + 6 numerals
               2 letters + 8 numerals
Protein:       3 letters + 5 numerals
               3 letters + 7 numerals
WGS:           4 letters + 2 numerals for WGS assembly version + 6 or more numerals
               6 letters + 2 numerals for WGS assembly version + 7 or more numerals
MGA:           5 letters + 7 numerals

###4-20-2021,
Update 1: All my previous running code is no longer operational. I'm currently attempting to get ggplot2 to work again- I'm trying to reinstall tidyverse. Ahhh- coding is very frustrating. Attempted to restart R- still didn't work.
Update 2: I'll try to reset my computer to get it to work.
